My design approach for this was to lay out a basic html and css format that would be responsive to the mobile format first
then turned my attention towards making a newer more mobile friendly "session expired alert". After that went and
tweaked the CSS to better resemble the page. Where i encountered the most problems was the sign in button and unfortunatly
could not enable it to work at this time.
